📘 What I Learned
Participating in this portfolio challenge has significantly boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of frontend development using just HTML and CSS. Here are a few key things I learned:

Responsive Design Techniques: I learned how to use Flexbox and media queries to create a layout that adapts well across different screen sizes. This was especially useful in making my profile picture and content stack properly on mobile.

Form Integration with Formspree: I discovered how to implement a contact form without JavaScript by using Formspree, which allowed me to handle form submissions via email effortlessly.

CSS Styling & Theming: I explored how to create a consistent color theme (black background with gold highlights) and how to apply gradients, rounded buttons, and smooth transitions to make the UI visually appealing.

Dark Mode Design: Although limited by the no-JavaScript requirement, I practiced designing with dark mode in mind and learned how to use prefers-color-scheme and toggle-friendly CSS techniques.

Organizing Content Semantically: I gained more awareness about writing clean and semantic HTML that is accessible and easy to navigate for both users and developers.

Version Control with Git: This project helped me reinforce my Git and GitHub skills—committing changes, writing meaningful commit messages, and hosting with GitHub Pages.

Documentation & Presentation: I learned the importance of clear documentation through a well-structured README.md, which showcases my thought process and makes it easy for others to understand my work.
